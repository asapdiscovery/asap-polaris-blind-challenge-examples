"2024-12-03,10:54:09",jj700physics,#0,"Good morning. I wanted to ask about the antiviral-admet-2025. I read the blog post and competition details, but I could not find any info on how the data is curated? By any chance, do you have info on this? I just want to decide if I need to find more data for this competition. Thanks",,
"2024-12-03,12:54:16",cwognum,#0,"Hi <@533263458486190081> , the data was consistently generated for ASAP through institutions like the Weizmann Institute, the University of Oxford, and industry standard CROs. We thus didn't have to do much curation. 

For the ML-ready datasets that will be made available through the Polaris API, we did the following: 
- For potency and ADMET, filter out any data points for which the modifier was not ""=""
- For poses, we prepared the structural data using Spruce (https://www.eyesopen.com/spruce) and aligned them with a reference Mpro, with CONECT records

See the sample datasets, for example: 
- https://polarishub.io/datasets/asap-discovery/antiviral-potency-2025-sample
- https://polarishub.io/datasets/asap-discovery/antiviral-ligand-poses-2025-sample
- https://polarishub.io/datasets/asap-discovery/antiviral-admet-2025-sample

You're free to use any extra data (and we recommend it!). We're curious to see if anyone could've done better than we did, and we had access to other public data as well.",jj700physics#0,

"2025-01-15,10:15:20",cwognum,#0,"That’s a good question! 

For the Complex Structure, the answer is simply that this structure includes the ligand and thus the solution to the task we’re asking you to solve! 😄

For the Protein Structure, the answer is a little more nuanced. The structure of the protein changes based on the ligand that is bound to it. If we were to provide you with the structure of the protein in its bound pose for a given ligand, that would give you additional information about the ligand pose that we’re asking you to predict. This is information you typically don’t have in a real world setting. We’ve therefore formulated the posing challenge as a “blind docking” task, where the ask is to predict the pose based on just the sequence data of the protein and the molecular graph (i.e. the CXSMILES). This is more representative of real-world applications.

if these are true duplicates that slipped through , we’ll indeed ignore them at test time.

~~However, can you confirm that the molecule is not paired with a different target? In other words: one molecule could be bound with both MERS CoV as well as SARS CoV 2. This would be expected and not an actual duplicate~~

This is a setting that you’ll run into a lot during real world drug discovery programs, for a variety of reasons like <@1328384613554585613> mentioned.

From a ML perspective, you’re working with a _sparse multitask matrix_. You could simply build single-task models for each individual endpoint, filtering out the NaNs, and then combine their predictions, but it would be interesting to see if you can benefit from the shared information between tasks to improve generalizability with some sort of multitask model! For example, you could use a model with a shared trunk and endpoint specific prediction heads.",jenkescheen.#0,
"2025-01-21,10:33:10",cwognum,#0,"Hey <@821170864568533033>, thanks again for reporting! We've looked into it. It's turns out to be quite an illustrative example!

Turns out: These aren't actually duplicates. They are enantiomers. In other words: These molecules share the same molecular formula and connectivity (i.e., the same number and type of atoms bound in the same sequence) and hence the same SMILES, but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. If you're not familiar with stereochemistry, you can learn more about it here: https://polaris-hub.github.io/auroris/stable/tutorials/stereoisomerism_QSAR.html. 

Stereochemistry matters a lot in binding and such enantiomers actually have different readouts in the assay. It would've been cool to provide the 3D arrangement associated with these enantiomers to allow for some more advanced modelling techniques, but we unfortunately have not been able to identify them. In other words, we know that these are enantiomers, but we don't precisely know which has which spatial arrangement.

It's a lesson in the limitations of the 2D graph representation (e.g. SMILES) we like to use in ML for our molecules and it is a reminder of the difficulty of data curation! 😅 

Finally, on how we handle these cases during evaluation. We'll simply skip them!

"2025-01-21,11:11:22",jenkescheen.,#0,"Thanks <@437941389838516235> ! Just to illustrate a bit more: as you'll have noticed we use an extended SMILES notation called CXSMILES. This format allows annotation of more stereochemical details beyond just the '@' in regular SMILES notation. For a good explanation of CXSMILES and enhanced stereochemistry notation, see Greg Landrum's excellent blogpost here: https://greglandrum.github.io/rdkit-blog/posts/2023-11-19-explaining-stereo-groups.html

To bring things back to this particular use-case: we're looking at five matched enantiomers that have 'OR' stereochemistry. That means that either entry can be either enantiomer (more simply put: we don't know which is which), but the synthesis team has not done the follow-up synthetic experiments to determine which exact enantiomer is which. This typically isn't done for compounds that aren't necessarily worth following up on, or when it's obvious which enantiomer is dominating in potency.",cwognum#0,

I'd like to pose a question regarding the ligand pose challenge. I'm curious how we could possibly load the training dataset in cif / mmcif format. Any recommended way to do so?",,
"2025-02-02,14:18:24",cwognum,#0,"Hi <@695190081698529353>, good question! 

The  `AtomArray` object that is returned by the competition can be easily converted to a CIF file through Biotite (https://www.biotite-python.org/latest/index.html). However, it's worth noting that the original data was provided as PDBs and I'm not sure if you still lack any information after the conversion because of that.

Having said that, here's a simple code snippet: 

```py
import polaris as po
from biotite.structure.io import save_structure 

# Load the competition
competititon = po.load_competition(""asap-discovery/antiviral-ligand-poses-2025"")

# Load a single datapoint, just to illustrate how to do the conversion. 
# Note that the type of atom_array is the Biotite AtomArray.
atom_array = competititon.get_data(row=0, col=""Complex Structure"")

# Save to CIF through Biotite
save_structure(""system.cif"", atom_array)
```",wiwnopgm#0,
"2025-02-02,15:06:45",wiwnopgm,#0,Thanks for clarification. It looks like original PDBs didn't come with the structure entities.,cwognum#0,

"2025-02-04,22:24:29",cwognum,#0,"Hey <@821170864568533033> , you’ll need to use the precise labels. If you print the value of `competition.target_cols`, you’ll see that it’s `[“pIC50 (MERS-CoV Mpro)”, “pIC50 (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro)”]`. 

In other words, it should be: 
```py
predictions = {
    “pIC50 (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro)”: …,
    “pIC50 (MERS-CoV Mpro)”: …

"2025-02-05,10:28:55",lexobrien.,#0,Did anyone get any information from the drop in sessions as to what the missing values in the ADMET dataset mean? Are they outside the detection limits?  Or experiment failed randomly?  Some other reason?,,
"2025-02-05,10:32:17",cwognum,#0,"Hey Lex, good question! During a drug discovery program one typically doesn't profile all molecules in all assays. For example, companies could organize their ADMET assays in a hierarchy (or funnel), where you only profile a molecule in an assay if it showed desirable properties in all previous assays. Working with a sparse multi-task matrix is thus common.

"2025-02-05,12:04:02",cwognum,#0,"That's indeed what happened in most cases. 

For completeness sake, it's worth noting that some of these missing values may also be because they were outside the detection limit, but that's a small portion.

"2025-02-14,10:23:42",jenkescheen.,#0,"hi <@821170864568533033> ! The same ligand will (almost always) have a different potency for two different proteins. At ASAP we are developing drug candidates fthat bind potently to two proteins (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro)  at the same time. For this reason we have measured potencies for both proteins. This means that in the training set, a given compound might have a potency measurement on the one protein or on the other (and in some cases both, but they will appear as different data points IIRC). 

Even though the proteins are very similar, there are some subtle differences (especially in the ligand binding region) that will cause some ligands to bind better to the one than to the other.

1. Incorrect alignment with the reference. Some people didn't quite get the alignment right which made their results look very bad. We are working on an example to make this easier and clearer.

The baseline uses structural information in the training set by selecting the most chemically similar ligands to then seed an common-substructure based openeye docking run. Main point being that the structural information from related ligands is used effectively.

"2025-02-20,07:27:26",lexobrien.,#0,"Hi folks, 

Question about the sensitivity range of the MLM and HLM measurements.  In the raw data (referencing HLM only in this message) you have clearance rates that appear below the sensitivity limit of the assay - these are marked '<10 (uL/min/mg)'.  These all have half lives marked as '>173min'.  This makes sense, this limit would be set by how long you can wait fo rthe assay to finish: shorter times restrict the length of measurable half life. 

 However, you also have some molecules which have clearance rates below 10 e.g., 0, 2, 3, ... with half lives longer than 173 minutes. The batch dates are almost all earlier for these molecules.  Can I infer that the later batches  had their assay times decreased and so the sensitivity was also decreased?",,

Our understanding of the data evolved with time. In January 2024 we did a retrospective analysis of % remaining against Clint assuming log linear decay (which we believed was valid) and concluded that  we could not confidently quote Clint values for measurements < 10 so set bounds on all future measurements at that point. We did not edit the previous calculations as we felt the data captured should reflect the analysis as it was made in the project. It would be valid for model building to censor the data where  Clint < 10 to:

For the technical details: We use Bootstrapping (`n=1000`) to sample the performance distribution. We then compare all performance distributions using the Tukey HSD test (implemented in `statsmodels` as `pairwise_tukeyhsd`). For the CLD, I couldn't find a robust implementation in Python (only R), so this was implemented from scratch. Assigning the letters is actually a NP-hard problem. I used the insert-absorb approximation. I just uploaded my code in case you're interested: https://github.com/asapdiscovery/asap-polaris-blind-challenge-examples/blob/main/cld.py

Then a note on Bootstrapping: We acknowledge that bootstrapping likely underestimates variance. Ideally, we would use Cross-Validation, but this is not compatible with the challenge format and we are not aware of any other better sampling techniques.

I believe some of the provided Mpro sequences might be incomplete—for example, the helix with the AA sequence ""SEDML,"" which forms part of the binding pocket, is missing in some sequences, which might affect results.
4) Are all ligands non-covalent? It looks like some have electrophilic groups that might form covalent bonds.

For this challenge, we've derived the sequence from the crystal structure, which explains the occasional gaps that you see. As all crystals were produced with the same construct, it would make sense for the construct’s sequence to be the shared reference, so in cases where you observe gaps you might want to refer to the 'canonical' sequence.

I actually break down the molecules in a slightly different way when doing fragment constrained generation and will share the statistics in a few days. In a nutshell, since all of the Mpro inhibitors contain multiple ring structure, I break down the fragments so that each fragment contains one and only one complete ring structure (fused ring counts as one ring structure) and then I search in the training set to see if there are any identical fragments. If I remember it right, more than 80% of the test molecules have at least one identical ring fragments based on my formulation.

I would also suggest maybe checking the MCES similarity between molecules using just their Murcko scaffold (rdkit has an easy function to call to extract murcko scaffold from a molecule)?

One thing that annoys me about ML research in Drug Discovery is grandiose claims of having ""solved"" drug discovery. I would love for us to clearly characterize the problem this competition presented, e.g. by analyzing the distribution shifts between train and test (e.g. k-NN ECFP + Tanimoto distance from test to train). This will help for more nuanced claims: We're not solving all of drug discovery, but have identified some techniques that work well within this specific scope.

Any ideas on how we could do this for these three challenges? 👀",gpcr#0,
"2025-04-08,12:48:30",cwognum,#0,"Some random thoughts: 

- To characterize the chemical space, we could compute the distance from test to train:
  - For potency and ADMET: ECFP + Tanimoto or MCS seems to be a reasonable distance measure.
  - For poses, we can use the Runs 'N Poses metric? https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.03.636309v2.abstract
    - I like the barclode plot <@562621019454701568> did as well, and I think that would serve as a qualitative counter-part to this more quantitive similarity measure. 
- Would love for us to get a medchem perspective in there to provide context on how (dis)similar paired examples are. Maybe identify some chemical series?
- At least for ADMET and Potency, we can also show the difference in the target space distribution.
- A challenge here is what to do with other datasets that people used to (pre-)train methods. Maybe we can try our best to query related datasets from PDB (Plinder?) and ChEMBL. 

I think all of the above serves as a basis for carefully understanding model performance and can really help refine future competitions.",gpcr#0,
"2025-04-08,13:30:04",oliversun6788,#0,"On top of that, for ligand pose challenge, I personally think that it is extremely important to analyze the protein side chain flexibility. Based on my experience working with the target, for the key residue His41 (SARS), you can either have either sandwich or T-shaped pi stacking with the ligand. Also, the free loop area (L167-H172) that is very close to the binding pocket demonstrates some really significant side chain flexibility with different ligand (and during MD simulations).

Another potential thing that is kind of out of the scope of this project is the mutation analysis. I don't exactly know if this is something that the organizer is interested in pursuing but people have seen some potential mutations on Mpros that make ensitrelvir 1000x less potent. If the ultimate end goal is to do drug discovery, maybe some analysis on mutated proteins could be at least something to bring up if an in-depth analysis is not planned.",,

To get straight to the point, the success rate improved from 40% to 70%, and the mean RMSD dropped from 25Å to 2.0Å.
These improvements were achieved without re-docking; I simply applied the transformation matrix used to superimpose the reference SARS protein onto the MERS protein.
The RMSD distribution is shown below. Many cases narrowly missed the threshold, and when the success criterion is relaxed from 2.0Å to 2.5Å, the success rate increases to 84%.
